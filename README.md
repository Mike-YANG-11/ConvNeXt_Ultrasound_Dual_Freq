# ConvNeXt Ultrasound Dual Frequency
- We conducted several experiments on the dual frequency analysis of ultrasound images
  - Use a ConvNeXt model to classify the image label (needle or fascia)
- Results
  - Dual frequency images can improve the model's ability to differentiate the needle and fascia
  - High-Frequecy (HF) and Low-Frequecy (LF) might contains different information for needles and fascias in ultrasound image
- See `dual_freq.ipynb`
